PartCat - Electronic Components Cataloger and Organizer

=head1 SUMMARY

A simple project that aims to create a nice backend for a electronic component
catalog. This is only a backend, so the clients should be created separate from
this module.

=head1 SETUP

All you need to do is run C<make init> to create the database and a sample
configuration file for the application, then all you need to do is edit the
C<config/main.conf> file and change the settings to fit your needs.

=head1 TESTING

To make sure everything is perfect for deployment you can run C<make test>,
which will run all the unit tests to make sure that you have a working system.
